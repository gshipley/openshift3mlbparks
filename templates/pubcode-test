    The Forest Access Management (FAM) is a foundational product for other FSA
    apps. FAM will provide the opportunity for government staff  and external
    stakeholders to provision access to forestry suite of applications. FAM is
    being hosted on the AWS cloud in the Canada  Region and is managed by the
    SSO Cloud Pathfinder team.  FAM uses an Open ID Connect (OIDC) standard for
    safe and transparent  authentication. The purpose of this initiative is to
